Before your first flight
========================

Now you are ready for the first use of **Enroute Flight Navigation**.  General
operation is very intuitive.  Still, we recommend that you take a minute to make
yourself familiar with the moving map display and with the basic controls before
you take the app on its first flight.


The moving map
--------------

After startup, the app will show a moving map, similar in style to the standard
ICAO maps that most pilots are used to.  You can use the standard gestures to
zoom and pan the map to your liking.  The figures :ref:`movingMapGround` and
:ref:`movingMapFlight` shows how the map will typically look.

Initially, your own position is shown as a blue circle (or gray if the system
has not yet acquired a valid position).  Once you are moving, your own position
is shown as a blue arrow shape.  The flight path vector shows the projected
track for the next five minutes.

The bottom of the display shows a little panel with the following information.

====== ==============
T.TALT True altitude (=geometric altitude) above sea level.
FL     Flight level.
GS     Ground speed.
TT     True track.
UTC    Current time.
====== ==============

The flight level is only available if your device is connected to a traffic
receiver (such as a PowerFLARM device) that reports the pressure altitude.
Flight level and current time are hidden if the display is not wide enough.

.. warning:: Vertical airspace boundaries are defined by pressure altitudes
   (with respect to QNH or standard pressure).  Depending on temperature and air
   density, the pressure altitude will differ from the true altitude that is
   shown by the app.  **Never use true altitude to judge vertical distances to
   airspaces.**


Interactive controls
--------------------

In addition to the pan and pinch gestures, you can use the following buttons to
control the app.

============================= ========
.. image:: ic_menu.png        Open main menu
.. image:: NorthArrow.png     Switch between display modes **north up** and **track up**.
.. image:: ic_my_location.png Center map about own position.
.. image:: ic_add.png         Zoom in
.. image:: ic_remove.png      Zoom out
============================= ========


Information about airspaces, airfields and other facilities
-----------------------------------------------------------

Double tap or tap-and-hold anywhere in the map to obtain information about the
airspace situation at that point.  If you double tap or tap-and-hold on an
airfield, navaid or reporting point, detailed information about the facility
will be shown.  The figure :ref:`stuttgartInfo` shows how this will typically
look.

Go flying!
----------

**Enroute Flight Navigation** is designed to be simple.  We think that you are
now ready to take **Enroute Flight Navigation** on its first flight.  There are
of course many more things that you can do.  Play with the app and have a look
at the next section :ref:`sec-steps`.
