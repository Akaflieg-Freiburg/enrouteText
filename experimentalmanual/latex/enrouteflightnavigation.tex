Enroute Flight Navigation is a free flight navigation app for Android and other
devices. Designed to be simple, functional and elegant, it takes the stress out
of your next flight. The program has been written by flight enthusiasts, as a
project of \sphinxhref{https://akaflieg-freiburg.de/}{Akaflieg Freiburg}, a flight club
based in Freiburg, Germany.

Enroute Flight Navigation features a moving map, similar in style to the
official ICAO maps. Your current position and your flight path for the next five
minutes are marked, and so is your intended flight route. A double tap on the
display gives you all the information about airspaces, airfields and navaids \textendash{}
complete with frequencies, codes, elevations and runway information.

The free aeronautical maps can be downloaded for offline use. In addition to
airspaces, airfields and navaids, selected maps also show traffic circuits as
well as flight procedures for control zones. The maps receive near\sphinxhyphen{}weekly
updates and cover large parts of the world.

Enroute Flight Navigation includes flight weather data downloaded from the
\sphinxhref{https://www.aviationweather.gov/}{NOAA \sphinxhyphen{} Aviation Weather Center}.

While Enroute Flight Navigation is no substitute for full\sphinxhyphen{}featured flight
planning software, it allows you to quickly and easily compute distances,
courses and headings, and gives you an estimate for flight time and fuel
consumption. If the weather turns bad, the app will show you the closest
airfields for landing, complete with distances, directions, runway information
and frequencies.

\part{Getting started}


\chapter{Think before you fly}
\label{\detokenize{01-intro/think:think-before-you-fly}}\label{\detokenize{01-intro/think::doc}}
Enroute Flight Navigation is a free software product that has been published in
the hope that it might be useful as an aid to prudent navigation.  It comes with
no guarantees.  It may not work as expected.  Data shown to you might be wrong.
Your hardware may fail.

This app is no substitute for proper flight preparation or good pilotage.  Any
information \sphinxstylestrong{must always} be validated using an official navigation and
airspace data source.

\begin{sphinxadmonition}{warning}{Warning:}
Always use official flight navigation data for flight preparation
and navigate by officially authorized means. The use of non\sphinxhyphen{}certified
navigation devices and software like Enroute Flight Navigation as primary
source of navigation may cause accidents leading to loss of lives.
\end{sphinxadmonition}

We do not believe that the use of Enroute Flight Navigation fulfills the
requirement of the EU Regulation \sphinxhref{https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:281:0001:0066:EN:PDF}{No 923/2012:SERA.2010}
\begin{quote}

Before beginning a flight, the pilot\sphinxhyphen{}in\sphinxhyphen{}command of an aircraft shall become
familiar with all available information appropriate to the intended operation.
\end{quote}

To put it simply: relying on Enroute Flight Navigation as a primary means of
navigation is most likely illegal in your jurisdiction.  It is most certainly
stupid and potentially suicidal.


\section{Software limitations}
\label{\detokenize{01-intro/think:software-limitations}}
Enroute Flight Navigation is not an officially approved flight navigation
software.  It is not officially approved or certified in any way.  The software
comes with no guarantee and might contain bugs.


\section{Navigational data and aviation data}
\label{\detokenize{01-intro/think:navigational-data-and-aviation-data}}
Navigational\textendash{} and aviation data, including airspace and airfield information,
are provided “as is” and without any guarantee, official validation,
certification or warranty.  The data does not come from official sources.  It
might be incomplete, outdated or otherwise incorrect.


\section{Operating system limitations}
\label{\detokenize{01-intro/think:operating-system-limitations}}
We expect that most users will run the software on mobile phones or tablet
computers running the Android operating system.  Android is not officially
approved or certified for aviation.  While we expect that the app will run fine
for the vast majority of Android users, please keep the following in mind.
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
The Android operating system can decide at any time to terminate Enroute
Flight Navigation or to slow it down to clear resources for other apps.

\item {} 
Other apps might interfere with the operation of Enroute Flight Navigation.

\item {} 
Many hardware vendors, most notably One Plus, Huawei and Samsung equip their
phone with “battery saving apps” that randomly kill long\sphinxhyphen{}running processes.
These apps cannot be uninstalled by the users, do not comply with Android
standards and are often extremely buggy.  At times, users can manually excempt
apps from “battery saving mode”, but the settings are usually lost on system
updates.  Google’s own “Pixel” and “Nexus” devices do not have these problems.
See the web site \sphinxhref{https://dontkillmyapp.com}{Don’t kill my app} for more
information.

\end{itemize}


\section{Hardware limitations}
\label{\detokenize{01-intro/think:hardware-limitations}}
Enroute Flight Navigation runs on a variety of hardware platforms, but we expect
that most users will run the software on mobile phones, tablet computers and
comparable consumer electronic devices that are not certified to meet aviation
standards.  Keep the following in mind.
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
Your device might not be designed to operate continuously for extended periods
of time, in particular if the display is on.

\item {} 
Your device can overheat. Batteries can catch fire.

\item {} 
Battery capacity is limited.  Even if your is connected to power via a USB
cable, note that there are devices where display and/or CPU use more energy
than USB can deliver.

\end{itemize}


\chapter{Getting started}

\end{itemize}

\sphinxstylestrong{Class 1 and Class 2 maps:}
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
Class 1 maps are compiled from openAIP and open flightmaps data. These maps contain complete information about airspaces, airfields and navaids. In addition, the maps contain (mandatory) reporting points. Some of our tier 1 maps also show traffic circuits and flight procedures for control zones.

\item {} 
Class 2 maps are compiled from openAIP data only. They contain complete information about airspaces, airfields and navaids.

\end{itemize}

Details on the maps may be found at \textless{}\sphinxurl{https://akaflieg-freiburg.github.io/enroute/maps/}\textgreater{}
The Aeronautical Map data is selected on the “Map Library” \textendash{} “Aviation Data” page accessed via the “Settings” Menu.
To update the list of available maps the “…” option in the upper right corner of the screen may be used.
You may install or uninstall the aviation Map data for a county by the selection on the right hand side of the country list. To find a country you have to scroll up and down in the list.

\begin{sphinxadmonition}{note}{Note:}
To have optimum presentation of the Enroute Flight Navigation map display install the Aviation Map and the Base Map for all areas you intend to use Enroute Flight Navigation.
\end{sphinxadmonition}

\begin{sphinxadmonition}{caution}{Caution:}
No airspace information will be provided in country when the Aeronautical Map is not installed for it.
\end{sphinxadmonition}

\begin{sphinxadmonition}{note}{Note:}
“Enroute Flight Navigation” will automatically check for updated Maps on the Enroute server and show a pop\sphinxhyphen{}up window after start if updated maps have been detected.
You will be asked if you want to update the map or delay the update.
\end{sphinxadmonition}

\sphinxstylestrong{Base Map}

The Base Map layers is showing the geographic data on the Map screen. If no Base Map is shown for an area it will be shown in the white background color. If no Aviation Map is installed for the area only the information coming from the Base Map data is displayed. The Base Map is organized in tiles. This will result in not stopping the Base Map display abruptly at the border of an installed country, but showing some overlap.
The Base Map will show:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
Landmass

\item {} 
Water Surface (oceans, lakes and rivers)

\item {} 
Forests

\item {} 
Main Roads

\item {} 
Railroad lines

\item {} 
City names

\end{itemize}

\begin{sphinxadmonition}{note}{Note:}
To have optimum presentation of the Enroute Flight Navigation map display install the Aeronautical Map and the Base Map for all areas you intend to use Enroute Flight Navigation.
\end{sphinxadmonition}

\begin{sphinxadmonition}{note}{Note:}
“Enroute Flight Navigation” will not show  most cultural build ups and limits or settled area boundaries to reduce the map size.
\end{sphinxadmonition}


\section{Flight mode and ground mode}
\label{\detokenize{01-intro/getting_started:flight-mode-and-ground-mode}}
\sphinxstylestrong{Ground Mode}
Ground Mode is displayed by Enroute Flight Navigation whenever the sensed speed is below the threshold and the Menu item ‘Automatic Flight Detection’ is not set to ‘Always in Flight Mode’.
Ground Mode does not display the Flight Data line at the lower end of the screen and is intended for flight planning.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\item {} 
Menu area

\end{enumerate}

There are two basic ways to plan a flight route:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
Menu \sphinxhyphen{} Route:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
Enter Waypoints

\item {} 
Edit existing Route

\item {}

\end{itemize}

\item {} \begin{description}
\item[{Double touch Maps and open Waypoints}] \leavevmode\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
Direct will make a route from present position to Waypoint

\item {} 
‘+’ to Route will add the Waypoint to the current Route

\end{itemize}

\end{description}

\end{itemize}

A Route will remain in Enroute Flight Navigation until overwritten or removed. Routes may be saved or shared.

\sphinxstylestrong{Flight Mode}

When Enroute Flight Navigation senses a speed above the threshold it will automatically switch to flight mode.
For the displays given in flight mode refer to Figure 3: Flight Mode (Track Up)
In flight mode the following additional items will be displayed:
* The own position will be changes from a dot to an arrow
* A segmented flight path for the next 5 minutes will be indicated
* A flight data line will indicate the following GPS data:
* Altitude in feet (or meters if metric units selected)
* Ground Speed in knots (or km/h if metric units selected)
* Track in reference to true north
* Universal Coordinated Time (UTC)

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\item {} 
North Indicator, also area to switch between track up and north up

\item {} 
Center on Position area

\item {} 
Zoom area

\item {} 
Menu area

\end{enumerate}

The  Enroute Flight Navigation map display is automatically centered to display the own position to have about 80 \% of the display area in direction  of flight.
The map display may be shifted by touching the display and moving it to the desired position. After shifting the  “Center on Position”  Symbol will be displayed. After touching he  “Center on Position”  Symbol the map will be centered to give maximum map area in direction of flight again.

\sphinxstylestrong{Track Up and North Up Mode}

The Enroute Flight Navigation map display may be switched between a Track Up display and a North Up display by touching the gray window in the upper right area.
Touching the display orientation area toggles between North up and Track Up.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\end{enumerate}

The North Up mode provides a map display always showing the map north up.
The  Enroute Flight Navigation map display in North Up mode will center the display to provide about 80\% area in direction of flight.
In case the map display has been manually rotated the area besides the direction arrow will show the map orientation in degrees.


\section{Your first flight}
\label{\detokenize{01-intro/getting_started:your-first-flight}}
Now you are ready for the first use of Enroute Flight Navigation General operation is very intuitive. The primary purpose of Enroute Flight Navigation of displaying a moving aeronautical map is directly available after starting the app.
Before using the moving map function you have to make sure the GPS of your mobile device is operating properly. The own position indicator will be gray if GPS position is not available and will be displayed in blue color if GPS position is available. The own position will be indicated as round shape when no motion is sensed and displayed as arrow with flight path marker when moving.

\begin{sphinxadmonition}{warning}{Warning:}
Make sure the GPS position is correct and valid to avoid loss of situational awareness. Loss of situational awareness is a common cause of severe accidents in aviation.
\end{sphinxadmonition}

\sphinxstylestrong{Route \textendash{} Aircraft and Wind}

The Aircraft and Wind sub\sphinxhyphen{}pages of the Route page allows to enter aircraft performance and wind data required for navigational calculations.
The Aircraft Data will be used to determine the distance of the flight and the true course.
The Wind data will will be used to calculate the true heading and duration of the flight. The duration of the flight will determine the fuel used.
Enroute Flight Navigation only offers a very superficial flight planning and cannot replace a full flight planning, but is only intended to provide quick reference.

\begin{sphinxadmonition}{warning}{Warning:}
Always perform a full flight preparation in accordance with the flight manual of the aircraft used. The use of Enroute Flight Navigation as primary flight planning may cause accidents leading to loss of lives.
\end{sphinxadmonition}

\sphinxstylestrong{Open AIP}

Open AIP has the goal to deliver free, current and precise data for air navigation to everyone. Open AIP is a web based and crowd\sphinxhyphen{}sourced platform.
The Open AIP provides the basic source aeronautical data for display in Enroute Flight Navigation.

\sphinxstylestrong{Open Flight Maps}

Open Flight Maps is an open\sphinxhyphen{}source project providing aeronautical data for a high quality VFR Map.
Open Flight Maps is providing some additional information, where available.

The detailed split of the data sources for the Enroute Flight Naviagtion map is shown below:

\sphinxstylestrong{Map Tiler}

Is a software application to combine multiple layers of data for maps and provide the map in a format for loading and display.
The Enroute Flight Naviagtion base maps are edited versions of maps kindly provided by Klokan Technologies through the OpenMapTiles project.

\sphinxstylestrong{Open Street Map}

Open Street Map (OSM) is a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world. The geodata underlying the map is considered the primary output of the project. The creation and growth of OSM has been motivated by restrictions on use or availability of map data across much of the world, and the advent of inexpensive portable satellite navigation devices.
The Open Street Map data is used to crate the base maps.


\chapter{Weather}
\label{\detokenize{02-reference/weather:weather}}\label{\detokenize{02-reference/weather::doc}}
The Weather page is opened via the Menu by touching the “Weather” entry.
The Weather page will display the station overview list for all currently available meteorological reports within 200 NM of the current position.

\end{enumerate}

The weather data is downloaded from the National Weather Service of the United States of America.

\begin{sphinxadmonition}{note}{Note:}
When opening the Weather page the first time you will have to confirm that you agree to download data from the NWS server to use this service.
\end{sphinxadmonition}

The menu of the Waether page will allow to:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
Update the METAR and TAF data

\item {} 
Disallow he internet connection

\end{itemize}

The Weather overview window will provide the following information based on the METAR:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
ICAO identifier for Station and Airport name

\item {} 
Distance and magnetic Bearing to Airport

\item {} 
Time of METAR and summary weather state

\end{itemize}

On the lower end of the weather page the following data relevant to your current position will be displayed:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
QNH

\item {} 
Location and time of the report the QNH was extracted

\item {} 
Sunset during day or Sunrise during night at current location

\item {} 
Remaining time until sunset or sunrise

\end{itemize}

The information of each airport will be color coded by a system established by the US National Weather Service. The coding scheme is explained in the table below.
When touching a station line METAR and TAF (if available) will be shown in a weather detail sub\sphinxhyphen{}page
