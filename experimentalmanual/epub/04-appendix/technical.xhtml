<h2>Traffic Receiver</h2>
<p><strong>Enroute Flight Navigation</strong> expects that the traffic receiver deploys a WLAN
network via Wi-Fi and publishes traffic data via that network.  In order to
support a wide range of devices, including flight simulators, the app listens to
several network addresses simultaneously.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The app tries to establish TCP connections to port 2000 at the IP addresses
192.168.1.1 and 192.168.10.1, where it expects to read a stream of FLARM/NMEA
sentences.  The NMEA sentences must conform to the specification outlined in the
document FTD-012 <a class="reference external" href="https://flarm.com/support/manuals-documents/">Data Port Interface Control Document (ICD)</a><span class="link-target"> [https://flarm.com/support/manuals-documents/]</span>, Version 7.13, as published by
<a class="reference external" href="https://flarm.com/">FLARM Technology Ltd</a><span class="link-target"> [https://flarm.com/]</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The app tries to establish UDP connections to ports 4000 and 49002, where it
expects datagrams in GDL90 or XGPS format.  The datagrams must conform to the
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/programs/adsb/archival/media/gdl90_public_icd_reva.pdf">GDL 90 Data Interface Specification</a><span class="link-target"> [https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/programs/adsb/archival/media/gdl90_public_icd_reva.pdf]</span>
or the XGPS format specified on the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.foreflight.com/support/network-gps/">ForeFlight Web site</a><span class="link-target"> [https://www.foreflight.com/support/network-gps/]</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When running on Android, the app acquires a WiFi lock as soon as valid data is
received.  The lock is released when data no longer arrives.</p>
