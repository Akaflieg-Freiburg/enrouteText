<h1>Connect your flight simulator</h1>
<p><strong>Enroute Flight Navigation</strong> can connect to flight simulator software.  The app
has been tested with the following programs.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.x-plane.com/">X-Plane 11</a><span class="link-target"> [https://www.x-plane.com/]</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Users have reported success with the following programs.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.x-plane.com/">X-Plane 10</a><span class="link-target"> [https://www.x-plane.com/]</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Please contact us if you are aware of other programs that also work.</p>

<h2>Before you connect</h2>
<p>This manual assumes a typical home setup, where both the computer that runs the
flight simulator and the device that runs <strong>Enroute Flight Navigation</strong> are
connected to a Wi-Fi network deployed by a home router.  Make sure that the
following conditions are met.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The computer that runs the flight simulator and the device that runs <strong>Enroute
Flight Navigation</strong> are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.  Some routers
deploy two networks, often called “main network” and a “guest network”.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure that the router allows data transfer between the devices in the
Wi-Fi network.  Some routers have “security settings” that disallow data
transfer between the devices in the “guest network”</p></li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="set-up-your-flight-simulator">
<h2>Set up your flight simulator</h2>
<p>Your flight simulation software needs to broadcast position and traffic
information over the Wi-Fi network.  Once this is done, there is no further
setup required.  As soon as the flight simulator starts to broadcast information
over the Wi-Fi network, the moving map of <strong>Enroute Flight Navigation</strong> will
adjust accordingly.  To end the connection to the flight simulator, simply leave
the flight simulator’s Wi-Fi network.</p>

<h3>X-Plane 10</h3>
<p>Follow the explanation on <a class="reference external" href="https://www.x-plane.com/2012/08/foreflight-charts-supported-in-x-plane-10-10-beta-9/">this page</a><span class="link-target"> [https://www.x-plane.com/2012/08/foreflight-charts-supported-in-x-plane-10-10-beta-9/]</span>,
which explains how to connect X-Plane 10 to the commercial app ForeFlight.  In
short: Open the “Settings” window and click “Internet Options”. There, go to the
“iPhone/iPod” tab and turn on the “ForeFlight” option.  Please be sure to
disable output of data on tab “Data”.</p>

<h3>X-Plane 11</h3>
<p>Open the “Settings” window and choose the “Network” tab.  Locate the settings
group “This machine’s role” on the right-hand side of the tab. Open the section
“iPHONE, iPAD, and EXTERNAL APPS” and select the item “Broadcast to all mapping
apps on the network” under the headline “OTHER MAPPING APPS”.</p>

<p>The flight simulator needs to be set up to send UDP datagrams in one of the
standard formats “GDL90” or “XGPS” to ports 4000 or 49002.  Given the choice,
GDL90 is generally the preferred format.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p><strong>Enroute Flight Navigation</strong> treats flight simulators as traffic receivers.  To
see the connection status, open the main menu and navigate to the “Information”
menu.  If the entry “Traffic Receiver” is highlighted in green, then <strong>Enroute
Flight Navigation</strong> has already found the program in the network and has
connected to it.  If not, then select the entry. The “Traffic Receiver Status”
page will open, which explains the connection status in more detail.</p>
