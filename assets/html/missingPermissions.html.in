<h3>Missing Permissions</h3>

<p>The app <strong>enroute flight navigation</strong> will not start because
  some essential permissions have not been granted.  Please re-start the app and
  grant the required permissions.  If you have chosen to deny some permissions
  permanently, you may need to go to the Android Settings app to grant the
  permissions there.</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://akaflieg-freiburg.github.io/enroute/privacy#privileges-of-the-android-app"
  title="privacy policies">privacy policies</a> explain why the permissions are
  needed and what they are used for.</p>

<p>Fly safely and enjoy many happy landings!</p>
