<h3>Too many maps</h3>

<p>Thank you for using enroute flight navigation, we appreciate your engagement very much.</p>

<p>However, we'd like to ask you <strong>to limit yourself to 8 %1.</strong>

<p>On the one hand, the bandwidth for map downloads is kindly sponsored by the University of Freiburg,
under the assumption that <strong>the costs stays within reasonable limits.</strong></p>

<p>On the other, the enroute app will perform much better if it doesn't have to process many megabytes of map-data at once.</p>

<p>We are trying our best to avoid a hard limit on the number of maps in the future. Please help us with that. You already have <strong>%2 maps</strong>.
