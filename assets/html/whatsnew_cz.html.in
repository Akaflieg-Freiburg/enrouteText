<p>This version is a major milestone for us.  Many things have changed
  internally, but not all of the changes are immediately visible to the
  user.</p>

<p>In response to requests by our users, flight routes can now be saved for
  later use.  With a bit of know-how, it is now even possible to use standard
  file synchronization software to share a library of flight routes among
  several devices.</p>

<p>Johannes Zellner has joined the development team. He implemented code that
  allows to share flight routes with other apps.  If desired, you can also
  import flight routes in GPX format from other programs, such as "fl95.de".
  Johannes also implemented geoid altitude correction, which tracks the
  different definitions of 'sea level' used in aviation and in satellite
  navigation.  The corrections will be applied automatically and will give more
  precise altitude readings.</p>
