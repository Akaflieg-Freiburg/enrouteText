==========

There are two basic ways to plan a flight route:

* Menu - Route:

    * Enter Waypoints
    * Edit existing Route
    * Enter Wind data
    * Enter Aircraft data

* Double touch Maps and open Waypoints
    * Direct will make a route from present position to Waypoint
    * '+' to Route will add the Waypoint to the current Route

A Route will remain in **Enroute Flight Navigation** until overwritten or
removed. Routes may be saved or shared.



The **Enroute Flight Navigation** map display is automatically centered to
display the own position to have about 80 % of the display area in direction of
flight.  The map display may be shifted by touching the display and moving it to
the desired position. After shifting the “Center on Position” Symbol will be
displayed. After touching he “Center on Position” Symbol the map will be
centered to give maximum map area in direction of flight again.

**Track Up and North Up Mode**

The **Enroute Flight Navigation** map display may be switched between a Track Up
display and a North Up display by touching the gray window in the upper right
area.  Touching the display orientation area toggles between North up and Track
Up.

The North Up mode provides a map display always showing the map north up.  The
**Enroute Flight Navigation** map display in North Up mode will center the
display to provide about 80% area in direction of flight.  In case the map
display has been manually rotated the area besides the direction arrow will show
the map orientation in degrees.
