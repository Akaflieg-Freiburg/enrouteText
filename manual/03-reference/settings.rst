Settings
========

**Enroute Flight Navigation** is designed to be simple. The number of user
settings is deliberately small. To access the user settings, open the main menu
and choose "Settings." 


Moving Map
----------

The settings grouped under "Moving Map" change the appearance of the map
display.


Airspace Altitude Limit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you never fly higher than 5.000ft, you will probably not be interested in
airspaces that begin above FL100. **Enroute Flight Navigation** allows you to
set an altitude limit to improve the readability of the moving map. Once set,
the app will show only airspaces below that limit. Tap on the entry “Airspace
Altitude Limit” to set or unset the altitude limit. 

Once you set an altitude limit, the moving map will display a little warning
(“Airspaces up to 9,500 ft”) to remind you that the moving map does not show all
airspaces. The app will automatically increase the limit when your aircraft
approaches the altitude limit from below.

.. warning:: Airspace boundaries are often flight levels. The true altitude of a
    flight level depends on meteorological conditions (such as the temperature 
    gradient) and is not known to **Enroute Flight Navigation**. When deciding 
    which airspace to show, the app will use an approximation. The approximation 
    might be off by 1,000ft or more in extreme weather. **Always leave an ample 
    safety margin when setting an airspace altitude limit.**
    

Hide Gliding Sectors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In regions with high glider traffic, local regulations often allow gliders to
fly in airspaces that are otherwise difficult to access, such as control zones.
The moving map displays these “Gliding Sectors” in bright yellow. If you are not
flying a glider, the gliding sectors are probably not relevant. Hiding the
gliding sectors might improve the readability of the moving map.


System
------

Night Mode
^^^^^^^^^^

The “Night Mode” of Enroute Flight Navigation is similar to the “Dark Mode”
found in many other apps. We designed the night mode for pilots performing VFR
flights by night, whose eyes have adapted to the darkness. Compared with other
apps, you will find that the display is quite dark indeed.
