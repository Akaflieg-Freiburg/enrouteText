Airspace Display
================

The display of airspace will generally follow the common ICAO symbology.

.. note::
    The Airspace structure at an arbitrary point may be seen by double touching the point on the screen. This will select the point as a waypoint. The waypoint pop-up window shows the information on the waypoint including airspace structure. This technique is also helpful to view the data and vertical limits of special use airspace.

Restricted Airspace
-------------------
Restricted airspace are surrounded by an intense red dashed line and a thick transparent red line inside the restricted area boundaries. 
When selecting a point inside the restricted area by double touching the screen the information to the related area is given with the waypoint pop-up window:

* Area Name
* Area altitude limits
* Area activation time


Controlled Airspace 
-------------------
All boundaries of controlled airspace are indicated by a solid blue line and a thick transparent blue line inside the airspace. 
When selecting a point inside the controlled airspace by double touching the screen the information to the related area is given with the waypoint pop-up window:

* Airspace designation
* Vertical Limits
* Other airspace at location

.. note::
    Communication frequencies are shown in the pop-up window related to the station or aerodrome.

    All controlled airspace (Class A â€“ Class D) are shown in the same way even if different restrictions or ATC clearance requirements may be present.

Control Zone
------------
The Control Zone of an airport is indicated by a dashed blue line filled in transparent red color. 
When selecting a point inside the Control Zone (CTR) by double touching the screen the CTR designation and vertical limit is given within the waypoint pop-up window.

.. note::
    Communication frequencies are shown in the pop-up window related to the station or aerodrome.

Transponder Mandatory Zones
---------------------------
Transponder Mandatory Zones TMZ are indicated by a black dashed outline.
When selecting a point inside the Transponder Mandatory Zone (TMZ) by double touching the screen the information to the related ares is given with the waypoint pop-up window:

    * Area Name
    * Area altitude limits
    * Monitoring Frequency
    * Mode 3 Squawk

Radio Mandatory Zone
--------------------
Radio Mandatory Zones (RMZ) are indicated by a solid blue dashed outline and filled in transparent blue.
When selecting a point inside the Radio Mandatory Zone (RMZ) by double touching the screen the information to the related area is given with the waypoint pop-up window:

* Area Name
* Area altitude limits
* Radio Frequency

Parachute Jumping Areas
-----------------------
Parachute Jumping Exercise areas (PJE) are indicated with a solid red dashed outline.
When selecting a point inside the PJE by double touching the screen the information to the related area is given with the waypoint pop-up window:

* Area Name
* Area altitude limits
* Radio Frequency

Nature Reserve Areas
--------------------
Nature Reserve Areas (NRA) are indicated with a solid green outline.
When selecting a point inside the NRA by double touching the screen the information to the related area is given with the waypoint pop-up window:

* Area Name
* Area altitude limits

.. caution::
    Check restrictions applicable for flying inside NRA when planning your flight. For example in Austria high fines are applicable when flying inside NRA.


Airfields
---------
The symbology used to display airfields follows the ICAO rules.
When selecting an airfield by double touching the screen the related Airfield Information is given in a pop-up window:

* Airfield Name and Identifier
* Radio Frequency including COM and Information frequencies
* Navaid frequencies
* Runway orientation, dimensions and surface
* Field elevation
* Data for associated airspace
* Approach and Departure Routes


Approach routes to airfields are shown as solid blue lines. The designation of the route is written along the paths. The associated reporting points are shown as blue triangles with a dashed circle and the reporting point designation.
Approach Routes will be shown by a solid line and Departure Routes will be shown as dashed lines.

.. note::
    Approach Routes will only be displayed when zooming into the area.


Traffic Pattern
---------------

Traffic pattern for motorized aircraft are shown as blue lines.
Traffic circuits for gliders or Ultralight aircraft are shown as red lines.
Entry and exit routes to traffic pattern are indicated by open ends of the pattern.
The traffic circuit will show the traffic circuit altitude when the information is available.

.. note::
    Traffic pattern will only be displayed when zooming into the area.
