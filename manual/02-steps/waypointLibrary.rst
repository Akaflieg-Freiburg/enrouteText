Manage a waypoint library
=========================


What to expect
--------------

**Enroute Flight Navigation** allows you to build a small library of waypoints
that can be used in flight routes and shared with others. For the typical user,
the library might contain a list of touristic landmarks ("Hohenzollern Castle"),
or perhaps a list of emergency landing fields. The waypoints from the library
are shown in the moving map. 

.. note:: 
  The waypoint library has been designed with small libraries in mind. If you 
  import files containing thousands of waypoints, you might find that the moving
  map of **Enroute Flight Navigation** slows down considerably.


Add waypoints to the library
----------------------------

To add a waypoint to the library, tap-and-hold onto the moving map, so that the
waypoint description dialog opens.  In that dialog, click on "Library/Add…"
Before saving, it is possible to assign a name and to edit the coordinates of
the waypoint.


View the waypoint library
-------------------------

To open the waypoint library, go to the main menu and choose the item
"Library/Waypoints."  


Import waypoints
----------------

**Enroute Flight Navigation** is able to import waypoints from files in CUP,
GeoJSON or GPX format. 

- On Android devices, transfer the file to your device and open it there.
  Depending on the transfer mode, you can open the file after the Bluetooth
  transfer, in the Google Drive App, or perhaps in the e-mail client.  

- On the Linux desktop, drag-and-drop the file to the **Enroute Flight
  Navigation** window.  Alternatively, open the waypoint library by choosing
  "Library/Waypoints" from the main menu, and choose the item "Import" from the
  three-dot menu at the top right of the screen.


Export and share the waypoint library
-------------------------------------

**Enroute Flight Navigation** is can write the waypoint library to a file, which
can then be transferred to other devices, or opened with other apps. **Enroute
Flight Navigation** is able to write files in GeoJSON and GPX format. While GPX
is understood by most programs, GeoJSON is the preferred format for sharing data
between several instances of **Enroute Flight Navigation**.

To start, open the waypoint library by choosing "Library/Waypoints" from the
main menu.

- On Android devices, choose the item "Share…" from the three-dot menu at the
  top right of the screen, and choose the appropriate file type from the
  submenu.

- On the Linux desktop, choose the item "Export…" from the three-dot menu at the
  top right of the screen, and choose the appropriate file type from the
  submenu.


Open the waypoint library in another app
----------------------------------------

It is possible to open the waypoint library in another app. To start, open the
waypoint library by choosing "Library/Waypoints" from the main menu.  Once the
main library page is open, choose the item "Open in other app…" from the
three-dot menu at the top right of the screen, and choose the appropriate file
type from the submenu.
