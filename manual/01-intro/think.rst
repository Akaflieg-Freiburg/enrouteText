   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Think before you fly
====================

Enroute Flight Navigation is a free software product that has been published in
the hope that it might be useful as an aid to prudent navigation.  It comes with
no guarantees.  It may not work as expected.  Data shown to you might be wrong.
Your hardware may fail.

This app is no substitute for proper flight preparation or good pilotage.  Any
information **must always** be validated using an official navigation and
airspace data source.

.. warning:: Always use official flight navigation data for flight preparation
    and navigate by officially authorized means. The use of non-certified
    navigation devices and software like Enroute Flight Navigation as primary
    source of navigation may cause accidents leading to loss of lives.

We do not believe that the use of Enroute Flight Navigation fulfills the
requirement of the EU Regulation `No 923/2012:SERA.2010
<https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:281:0001:0066:EN:PDF>`_

  Before beginning a flight, the pilot-in-command of an aircraft shall become
  familiar with all available information appropriate to the intended operation.


To put it simply: relying on Enroute Flight Navigation as a primary means of
navigation is most likely illegal in your jurisdiction.  It is most certainly
stupid and potentially suicidal.



Software limitations
--------------------

Enroute Flight Navigation is not an officially approved flight navigation
software.  It is not officially approved or certified in any way.  The software
comes with no guarantee and might contain bugs.



Navigational data and aviation data
-----------------------------------

Navigational-- and aviation data, including airspace and airfield information,
are provided "as is" and without any guarantee, official validation,
certification or warranty.  The data does not come from official sources.  It
might be incomplete, outdated or otherwise incorrect.


Operating system limitations
----------------------------

We expect that most users will run the software on mobile phones or tablet
computers running the Android operating system.  Android is not officially
approved or certified for aviation.  While we expect that the app will run fine
for the vast majority of Android users, please keep the following in mind.

* The Android operating system can decide at any time to terminate Enroute
  Flight Navigation or to slow it down to clear resources for other apps.

* Other apps might interfere with the operation of Enroute Flight Navigation.

* Many hardware vendors, most notably One Plus, Huawei and Samsung equip their
  phone with "battery saving apps" that randomly kill long-running processes.
  These apps cannot be uninstalled by the users, do not comply with Android
  standards and are often extremely buggy.  At times, users can manually excempt
  apps from "battery saving mode", but the settings are usually lost on system
  updates.  Google's own "Pixel" and "Nexus" devices do not have these problems.
  See the web site `Don't kill my app <https://dontkillmyapp.com>`_ for more
  information.


Hardware limitations
--------------------

Enroute Flight Navigation runs on a variety of hardware platforms, but we expect
that most users will run the software on mobile phones, tablet computers and
comparable consumer electronic devices that are not certified to meet aviation
standards.  Keep the following in mind.

* Your device might not be designed to operate continuously for extended periods
  of time, in particular if the display is on.

* Your device can overheat. Batteries can catch fire.

* Battery capacity is limited.  Even if your is connected to power via a USB
  cable, note that there are devices where display and/or CPU use more energy
  than USB can deliver.
