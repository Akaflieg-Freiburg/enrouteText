Connect your flight simulator
=============================

**Enroute Flight Navigation** can connect to flight simulator software.  When
setup correctly, position and traffic information is sent from the flight
simulator via WiFi to the device that runs **Enroute Flight Navigation**.

The author has tested **Enroute Flight Navigation** with the following flight
simulator programs.

- `X-Plane 11`_

Users have reported success with the following programs.

- `FlightGear`_
- `MS Flight Simulator`_
- `X-Plane 10`_

Please contact us if you are aware of other programs that also work.

.. note:: **Enroute Flight Navigation** treats flight simulators as traffic
    receivers.  To see the connection status, open the main menu and navigate to
    the "Information" menu.


Before you connect
------------------

This manual assumes a typical home setup, where both the computer that runs the
flight simulator and the device that runs **Enroute Flight Navigation** are
connected to a Wi-Fi network deployed by a home router.  Make sure that the
following conditions are met.

- Open the "Settings" page in the main menu and tap on the entry "Primary
  position data source" and select the "Traffic data receiver" as the main
  source. **As long as the built-in satnav receiver is selected, all position
  information provided by your flight simulator is ignored.**

- The computer that runs the flight simulator and the device that runs **Enroute
  Flight Navigation** are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.  Some routers
  deploy two networks, often called "main network" and a "guest network".

- Make sure that the router allows data transfer between the devices in the
  Wi-Fi network.  Some routers have "security settings" that disallow data
  transfer between the devices in the "guest network"


Set up your flight simulator
----------------------------

Your flight simulation software needs to broadcast position and traffic
information over the Wi-Fi network.  Once this is done, there is no further
setup required.  As soon as the flight simulator starts to broadcast information
over the Wi-Fi network, the moving map of **Enroute Flight Navigation** will
adjust accordingly.  To end the connection to the flight simulator, simply leave
the flight simulator's Wi-Fi network.


FlightGear
^^^^^^^^^^

FlightGear works well, even though position information is only broadcast when
the simulated aircraft is moving.  The following two parameters in the text
field of the settings dialog need to be set::

  --generic=socket,out,1,255.255.255.255,49002,udp,foreflight-xgps
  --httpd=8080

MS Flight Simulator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to communicate with other programs, the MS Flight Simulator requires
additional software.  Users reported that **Enroute Flight Navigation** works
well with the following EFB-connector programs.

- `fs2ff <https://github.com/astenlund/fs2ff>`__ (free, open source)
- `XMapsy Essential <http://xmapsy.com/>`_ (commercial, inexpensive, does not
  provide barometric altitude data).
- `XMapsy V3 <http://xmapsy.com/>`_ (commercial, more expensive, provides
  barometric altitude data).

The `web site of the commerical EFB program ForeFlight
<https://foreflight.com/support/support-center/category/about-foreflight-mobile/204115275>`_
lists additional EFB-connector programs that might also work.
  
.. note:: In MSFS2020 cold and dark mode, traffic in the air will not been
    shown. You have to power on the avionics!

.. note:: At the time of writing (04Aug21), the MS Flight Simulator reports only
    traffic that has a tail number.  This is likely due to a bug in the MS
    Flight Simulator software.


fs2ff
  The program `fs2ff <https://github.com/astenlund/fs2ff>`__ does not require
  any complicated installation or setup, just download and run.  The latest
  release of fs2ff can be downloaded `here
  <https://github.com/astenlund/fs2ff/releases/latest>`__.  Detailed instruction
  are found `here
  <https://github.com/astenlund/fs2ff#fs2ff-flight-simulator-to-foreflight>`__.
  The figure :ref:`fs2ff-img` shows extremely simple settings window.

XMapsy Essential
  If you use XMapsy Essential, you need not to setup anything. Just start Xmapsy
  Essential and start MSFS2020. The broadcast address will be setup
  automatically.  The figure :ref:`XMapsyEssential` shows the settings.

XMapsy V3
  If you use XMapsy V3, set the “Message-Format” to “ADS-B/GDL90” and the
  “Preferred Technology” to SIMCONNECT.  To receive the correct altitude, be
  sure to check the box “GDL90 ownship geometric altitudes based on MSL”.  The
  figure :ref:`XMapsyV3` shows verified XMapsy V3 settings for proper work with
  MSFS2020.  The Broadcast address will be determined by Xmapsy and should not
  be touched except you have extended network configuration experience.

X-Plane 11
^^^^^^^^^^

Open the "Settings" window and choose the "Network" tab.  Locate the settings
group "This machine's role" on the right-hand side of the tab. Open the section
"iPHONE, iPAD, and EXTERNAL APPS" and select the item "Broadcast to all mapping
apps on the network" under the headline "OTHER MAPPING APPS".

X-Plane 10
^^^^^^^^^^

Follow the explanation on `this page
<https://www.x-plane.com/2012/08/foreflight-charts-supported-in-x-plane-10-10-beta-9/>`_,
which explains how to connect X-Plane 10 to the commercial app ForeFlight.  In
short: Open the "Settings" window and click "Internet Options". There, go to the
"iPhone/iPod" tab and turn on the "ForeFlight" option.  Please be sure to
disable output of data on tab "Data".

Other programs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The flight simulator needs to be set up to send UDP datagrams in one of the
standard formats "GDL90" or "XGPS" to ports 4000 or 49002.  Given the choice,
GDL90 is generally the preferred format.


Troubleshooting
---------------

**Enroute Flight Navigation** treats flight simulators as traffic receivers.  To
see the connection status, open the main menu and navigate to the "Information"
menu.  If the entry "Traffic Receiver" is highlighted in green, then **Enroute
Flight Navigation** has already found the program in the network and has
connected to it.  If not, then select the entry. The "Traffic Receiver Status"
page will open, which explains the connection status in more detail.
