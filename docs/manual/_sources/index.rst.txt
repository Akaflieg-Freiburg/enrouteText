Enroute Flight Navigation
#########################

**Enroute Flight Navigation** is a free flight navigation app for Android and
other devices.  Designed to be simple, functional and elegant, it takes the
stress out of your next flight. The program has been written by flight
enthusiasts, as a project of `Akaflieg Freiburg
<https://akaflieg-freiburg.de/>`_, a flight club based in Freiburg, Germany.

**Enroute Flight Navigation** features a moving map, similar in style to the
official ICAO maps. Your current position and your flight path for the next five
minutes are marked, and so is your intended flight route. A double tap on the
display gives you all the information about airspaces, airfields and navaids â€“
complete with frequencies, codes, elevations and runway information.

The free aeronautical maps can be downloaded for offline use. In addition to
airspaces, airfields and navaids, selected maps also show traffic circuits as
well as flight procedures for control zones. The maps receive near-weekly
updates and cover large parts of the world.

**Enroute Flight Navigation** includes flight weather data downloaded from the
`NOAA - Aviation Weather Center <https://www.aviationweather.gov/>`_.

While **Enroute Flight Navigation** is no substitute for full-featured flight
planning software, it allows you to quickly and easily compute distances,
courses and headings, and gives you an estimate for flight time and fuel
consumption. If the weather turns bad, the app will show you the closest
airfields for landing, complete with distances, directions, runway information
and frequencies.
