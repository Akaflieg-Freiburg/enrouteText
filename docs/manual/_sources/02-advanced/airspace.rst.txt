Import airspace data
====================

**Enroute Flight Navigation** comes with a set of aviation maps that cover large
parts of the world and are updated frequently. In addition, users can import
airspace data in standard `OpenAir
<http://www.winpilot.com/usersguide/userairspace.asp>`_ format. Aviation clubs
and airfield operators use this feature to distribute OpenAir files to their
members to highlight noise-sensitive areas or airspaces available by local
agreement.
