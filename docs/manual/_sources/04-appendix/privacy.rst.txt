Privacy policies
================

We do not process any personal data from you. All data that you enter (including
routes, waypoints, and aircraft specifics) is stored locally on your device, not
transmitted to us, and not processed by us. 

However, to ensure the functionality, the app must transmit following data to
servers on the internet.

- The app regularly checks for updates and allows downloading maps and data from
  a `server at the University of Freiburg
  <https://cplx.vm.uni-freiburg.de/storage>`_ to your device. In order to
  provide this functionality, your device's IP address must be transmitted to
  the server. Knowledge of the IP address is necessary for the server to
  respond. However, the server does not store any personal data about you in its
  log files. In particular, it does not store the IP address of your device in
  its log files. We can assure this because the server is under our control.

- The app shows METAR and TAF data for airfields near your current location and
  near your currently planned route. It also shows METARs and TAFs for waypoints
  that you open in the app.  In order to provide this functionality, your
  current location, your currently planned route, waypoint coordinates, and your
  device's IP address must be transmitted to web services at the `Aviation
  Weather Center <https://www.aviationweather.gov>`_.  Knowledge of the IP
  address is necessary for the web services to respond. The web services cannot
  read any other data from your device in the process. However, you must expect
  that your device's IP address will be stored together with the transmitted
  position data. The web services are operated by the US government and are
  beyond our control. Detailed information about these web services can be found
  at https://www.aviationweather.gov/dataserver.

- The app shows NOTAMs for places near your current location and near your
  currently planned route. It also shows NOTAMs for waypoints that you open in
  the app. In order to provide this functionality, your current location, your
  currently planned route, waypoint coordinates, and your device's IP address
  must be transmitted to web services at the `Federal Aviation Administration
  <https://api.faa.gov>`_. Knowledge of the IP address is necessary for the web
  services to respond. The web services cannot read any other data from your
  device in the process. However, you must expect that the IP address of your
  device will be stored together with the transmitted position data. The web
  services are operated by the US government and are beyond our control.
  Detailed information about these web services can be found at
